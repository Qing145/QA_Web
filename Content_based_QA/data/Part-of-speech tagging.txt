In corpus linguistics, part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging or PoS tagging or POST), also called grammatical tagging is the process of marking up a word in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its context. 

Once performed by hand, POS tagging is now done in the context of computational linguistics, using algorithms which associate discrete terms, as well as hidden parts of speech, by a set of descriptive tags. POS-tagging algorithms fall into two distinctive groups: rule-based and stochastic. 

E. Brill's tagger, one of the first and most widely used English POS-taggers, employs rule-based algorithms.

Part-of-speech tagging is harder than just having a list of words and their parts of speech, because some words can represent more than one part of speech at different times, and because some parts of speech are complex.

The main problem with POS tagging is ambiguity.

POS tagging finds applications in Named Entity Recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, question answering, and word sense disambiguation.
