In artificial neural networks, the activation function of a node defines the output of that node given an input or set of inputs. 
A standard integrated circuit can be seen as a digital network of activation functions that can be "ON" (1) or "OFF" (0), depending on input. This is similar to the linear perceptron in neural networks. However, only nonlinear activation functions allow such networks to compute nontrivial problems using only a small number of nodes, and such activation functions are called nonlinearities.
The purpose of the activation function is to introduce non-linearity into the output of a neuron
