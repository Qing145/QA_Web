Text segmentation is the process of dividing written text into meaningful units, such as words, sentences, or topics.  The term applies both to mental processes used by humans when reading text, and to artificial processes implemented in computers, which are the subject of natural language processing. The problem is non-trivial, because while some written languages have explicit word boundary markers, such as the word spaces of written English and the distinctive initial, medial and final letter shapes of Arabic, such signals are sometimes ambiguous and not present in all written languages.
Compare speech segmentation, the process of dividing speech into linguistically meaningful portions.
Text segmentation is an important aspect in developing text processing applications, such as Information Extraction, Document Summarization, Machine Translation (MT), Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, Language Modeling, and Speech Recognition.
