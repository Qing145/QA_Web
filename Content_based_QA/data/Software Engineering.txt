The term programmer is sometimes used as a synonym, but may also lack connotations of engineering education or skills.
Engineering techniques are used to inform the software development process which involves the definition, implementation, assessment, measurement, management, change, and improvement of the software life cycle process itself. It heavily uses software configuration management which is about systematically controlling changes to the configuration, and maintaining the integrity and traceability of the configuration and code throughout the system life cycle. Modern processes use software versioning.
Challenges of Software engineering are Shifting Project Requirements, Uneven Workload Distribution, Transitioning to DevOps and DevSecOps, Maintaining Quality, Integrating With Other Applications and Systems, Planning Accurately, Data Privacy, Rising Competition.

Software applications of Software engineering are Business software, Accounting software, Analytics, Data mining closely related to database, Decision support systems, Airline reservations, Banking.
